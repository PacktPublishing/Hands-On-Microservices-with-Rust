**Build, test, and deploy scalable and reactive microservices with Rust 2018**

## What is this book about?
Microservice architecture is sweeping the world as the de facto pattern for building web-based applications. Rust is a language particularly well-suited for building microservices. It is a new system programming language that offers a practical and safe alternative to C.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Get acquainted with leveraging Rust web programming 
* Get to grips with various Rust crates, such as hyper, Tokio, and Actix 
* Explore RESTful microservices with Rust 
* Understand how to pack Rust code to a container using Docker 
* Familiarize yourself with Reactive microservices 
* Deploy your microservices to modern cloud platforms such as AWS

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
let server = builder.serve(|| {
 service_fn_ok(|_| {
 Response::new(Body::from("Almost microservice..."))
 })
});
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for developers who have basic knowledge of RUST, and want to learn how to build, test, scale, and manage RUST microservices. No prior experience of writing microservices in RUST is assumed.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-17).
